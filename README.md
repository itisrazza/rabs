# Razza's Arch Bootstrapper

This is a collection of scripts for automating and standardising my Arch Linux installations, with my preferred defaults.

It only needs the Arch ISO to get started. Once the live environment is booted up, the following can be run to start the installation:

```
curl -O https://rabs.razza.io/rabs-install.sh
chmod a+x rabs-install
./rabs-install
```
