# Razza's Arch Linux Bootstrapper

This script was made to help me quickly bootstrap and get going with a new
Arch Linux installation tailored to my needs.

It only needs the Arch ISO to get started. Once the live environment is booted up, the following can be run to start the installation:

```
curl https://arch.razza.io/archbs.sh | bash
```
